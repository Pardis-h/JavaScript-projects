# JavaScript-projects
This is the entry repository for all essential projects for every Javascript developer.
Javascript is so widely adopted that most developers can't avoid it entirely during the course of their careers. Sooner or later, you need to face JS, and when you do, you need to be ready with practical and fundamental concepts of the Javascript programming language.

These projects are quite popular and can be a go-to resource for anyone looking to learn, and let's face it - Devs are always learning.ðŸ¤“
